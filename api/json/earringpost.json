Now, I'm not talking about the huge dangling body piercing style earrings or the gigantic diamonds rappers wear. I'm just talking about a small hoop or stud in the left (or both) ears. Some say, some guys look good wearing one. Others don't What kind of guys look good in an earring? What kind of look (hair styles\/clothing) do you think go well with one? Just looking for opinions here.",

Used for body modification, accessorizing garments and keeping in trends, earrings have been among us since the beginning of time. With the changing times and cultures, many stereotypes have been raised and quelled with all genders falling for the allure of these tiny ornaments. It\u2019s considered normal for females but for the males, questions arise as to why guys wear earrings at all.",

I don't mean like using gel and a comb to keep it tidy, that's fine, but going to the salon to have it styled and highlighted and straightened and all that stuff. That's not what men do, at least in my book. I'm kinda old school when it comes to how people dress and present themselves. When I see a guy and he looks all \"done up\" with the fake hair, fake tan, earrings, etc...",

If we\u2019re going to talk about the social silliness that were popular in the 70\u2019s and perpetuated to the late 90's (the form of thinking thankfully much rarer now) even then, no, there was never a social stereotype of \u2018both ears\u2019. It started with popular gay icons and men in general seeming to prefer the left ear for getting pierced, and jewellery seen as a more feminine practice was teased.",

A bit much, but it looked sexy on him! Anyway, as long as it doesn't look too \"hair-band\" I'm all for them. My favorite jewelry, btw, is the circular barbell with captive or screwed-on beads... that's what I wear in my upper ear piercings. About the hair style, I think any hairdo can work with an earring.",
